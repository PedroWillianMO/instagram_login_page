# Instragram Login Page

Project built as a way of evaluating module 2 of Santander Bootcamp Fullstack Developer by DIO.

The purpose of this project was to replicate the instagram login page using HTML & CSS, emphasizing the positioning of elements on the page using CSS with Flexbox.

As a customization, dynamism was added to the page using basic JavaScript.
